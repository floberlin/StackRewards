# StackRewards

## Description

Introducing "StackRewards", the next-generation employee motivation system built on Ethereum's Layer 2! Agile working just got a lot more exciting. With StackRewards, the traditional Kanban board experience is elevated. Now, not only do you get to organize and prioritize tasks seamlessly, but each task also comes with a tangible incentive!

Features:

Tokenized Tasks: Every task on the Kanban board has an associated reward. Successfully complete your task, have it reviewed, and you're in for a treat! Earn ERC-20 tokens or exclusive NFTs on Zora for your hard work.

Seamless Integration: Worried about the onboarding process? With ERC-4337 wallet support, employees can effortlessly log in using their existing G Suite, Office 365, or social accounts, making the transition into StackRewards smooth and straightforward.

Enhanced Scrum Engagement: Gone are the days when Scrum was just a methodology. With StackRewards, it's an adventure! Engage in tasks as you would challenges in a game, knowing there's a rewarding end.

Trust & Transparency: Built on the blockchain, StackRewards offers a transparent system where rewards are automatically dispensed upon successful task completion and review, eliminating any manual intervention or bias.

StackRewards is here to revolutionize the way teams approach Scrum. By merging the principles of agile working with the incentivizing powers of blockchain technology, we aim to foster a more rewarding, engaging, and challenging work environment for everyone.

Join us in making Agile not just a working model, but a rewarding experience!
